- npm run dev to run the website.
- command line to event directory and json-server events.json to start up the event server.

To be done in future:
- Responsive styling for the event box border is a bit awkward -> styling issue.
- When event box has less than 6 events listed, the event frame stretches over the space -> styling issue.
- Button color fade when hovering over is a bit weird -> styling issue.
- When sorting events by category after adding or removing an event, the block element turns black and not show the corresponding events. Refreshing the page solves -> probably a delay in loading the updated event data.
- Header sometimes disappears a bit into the page after resizing to smaller pages. But this doesn't happen for every size -> issue should be in the styling and responsiveness. All pages are responsive otherwise.
- Code may have some traces left of unused code/removed code after trying to solve several issues. A proper code cleanup will be done later.
